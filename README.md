### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**ShibaRise/SHIBARISE** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Establish a strong group of believers that work together to expand our community and grow our holders list.  
Acquire as many listing in as many places as possible, audits and team members. Promote on all social media platforms. Begin creation of social media platform 
that is based on crypto-currency. Begin construction of a Pay Out and Burn utility on website. Provide stable, safe, uninterrupted  gains by utilizing the already 
accumulated tax pool to purchase out whales and burn tokens purchased so circulating supply is constantly reduced and current market price is unaffected. Becoming a 
major figure in the crypto world by being listed on top exchanges and endorced by top leaders in the industry.
- SHIBA RISE was created to provide a safe place for people to wager their money or invest in a long term project without the fear of being involved in a Honey-Pot or Rug-Pull.
Our developer is an American who is transparent about current progress, goals, actions and pretty much anything you ask him. Our developer is also always capable of being reached
through various channels and is almost always live in Telegram. Our goal is to create a platform for socializing that involves crypto-currency and more. We want to incorporate
pay out feature that uses accumulated taxes to buy whales out safely by burning the tokens purchased. Reducing overall supply.
