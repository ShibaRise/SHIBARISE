Vision & Purpose

   SHIBARISE is a rose growing in the concrete. In the time of endless rug pulls and honeypots, SHIBARISE stands out because the team is constantly at work expanding our reach, developing the website, and doing everything necessary to provide organic growth and healthy community. The team is almost always able to be reached. The vision is to create an honest community backed crypto currency where people are personable and work on the project as a team. Our plan is to create a platform for communication among members involving a wallet, ranking system and advanced warning of fraudulent projects and actors. We also want to incorporate a Pay Out and Burn function in the future where some of the accumulated taxes will be used to allow whales to safely exit without harming our current market price.
Buy - Burn - Reflect

   SHIBARISE contract utilizes the 6% WHALE tax that is accumulated to fight off sell offs. Consider it an insurance for SHIBARISE value because the contract automatically puts it back into liquidity, burn and reflection. Itâ€™s a win, win, win. When someone sells, the contract buys. You will see sell orders of 200,000,000,000 coming from the same contract. What that is, is the original tax is accumulated in the form of SHIBARISE tokens and in order for it to split between marketing and buying back it converts to WBNB. This Wrapped BNB is then used to buy back after sales and provide rocket fuel (Marketing Funds). Also the tokens that are purchased are then reflected 2% back to hodlers, liquidity and a burn.
Marketing & Development

   Each transaction comes with a 3% tax. This tax is used for marketing, website development, audits, youtube videos, tiktok videos, tweets, sponsor, listings and more. It is the rocket fuel needed in order for healthy growth. The community has a huge roll in the direction of marketing. What do we want to save for? What do we do next? The community gets a vote.
Safe Pay Out and Burn

   Safe Pay Out and Burn Function (Theoretical) . The contract already accumulates a 3% tax on transactions. Down the road after listings in cg, cmc, kucoin and this is all stuff that happens in time with luck, hard work and dedication. 3% of daily volume on a pumping token is hugeâ€¦ big enough to allow people to choose to sell their tokens directly to a feature on our platform that uses the accumulated tax to buy their tokens and burn them. Therefore increasing the price rather than reducing when a whale decides to exit.

Tokenomics
Total Supply â€“ 1,000,000,000,000,000
Current Burned â€“ 22,XXX,XXX,XXX,XXX

  
  SHIBARISE has a contract within the contract. This Contract is referred to as either the whale or the SHIBA. This contract has an automatic buy back command. When someone sells the contract buys. This helps mitigate any major downfalls in price and in fact it assist in increasing the price during volume. I can not guarrentee you will not see two sells in a row because each transaction has a different speed of being completed.
   The contract also has a redistribution method when using the accumulated tax pool. This tax pool accumulates in the form of SHIBARISE tokens. You will see sell orders of 200,000,000,000, this is the already accumulated tax from previous sells and it is converting it to WBNB. This Wrapped BNB is then divided into portions described below.
